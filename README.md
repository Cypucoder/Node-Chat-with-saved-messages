Node Chat with saved messages

A simple node based chat system with mysql storage. 

If you want to test, you'll need to create a mysql database. The database must include:
* Table: status
* Variables: id, User, Status
* Make sure id variable is set to auto increment 

To run: 
1. Open command prompt or terminal
2. Point to directory
3. Run using "node index"
4. Go to "localhost:3000" in your browser
5. If an issue arises, make sure something isn't already running on port 3000 or switch port in index.js to something else
